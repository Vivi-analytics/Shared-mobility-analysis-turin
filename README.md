## Shared-mobility-analysis-turin
Data-driven analysis of shared-mobility in Turin, combining Python, spatial analysis, and business modeling to study demand, operations, and profitability.

## Project Overview
This project presents a data-driven analysis of shared electric scooter mobility in the city of Turin. Using real operational data, the analysis combines Python-based data processing, basic spatial analysis, and business-oriented reasoning to study usage patterns, operational efficiency, and potential profitability of shared e-mobility services.

The project was developed as part of a Master’s course and focuses on translating analytical results into clear, decision-relevant insights rather than on building complex predictive models.

## Objectives
- Analyze temporal and spatial usage patterns of shared electric scooter
- Identify high demand areas and peak usage periods
- Evaluate operational efficiency across different urban zones
- Discuss business feasibility and optimization opportunities from a data-driven perspective

## Data Description
- Real-world shared electric scooter trip data from the city of Turin (anonymized)
- Key variables include trip start/end time, geographic location, and trip distance
- Data used exclusively for academic analysis

## Key Analyses
- #Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)#
  - Distribution of trip duration and distance
  - Daily and weekly usage patterns
- #Spatial Analysis#
  - Identification of high-demand zones
  - Comparison of usage across different districts
- #Operational and Business Insights#
  - Relationship between usage frequency and revenue potential
  - Trade-offs between fleet density and operational efficiency
  - Data-driven suggestions for service optimization

  ## Tools and Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- spatial analysis techniques（QGIS）
- Data visualization（PowerBI）
- Business-oriented interpretation of analytical results

## My Role and Contribution
- Independently performed data cleaning, analysis, and interpretation
- Connected analytical findings with real operational and business considerations
- Prepared structured analysis reports and presented results during coursework

## Academic Context
Developed at Politecnico di Torino  
Course focus: Data analytics applied to urban systems and shared mobility

## Notes
This project is an academic and personal portfolio project. It is intended to demonstrate analytical reasoning, problem decomposition, and the ability to translate data into actionable insights, rather than production-level system development.
